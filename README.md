# MayDay

**MayDay alerts your friends when you're in trouble.**
*If you are unable to make a call or text, you can trigger a MayDay alert.*
*If you are on the run from a psychopath or have fallen and can't get up, 
MayDay will transmit your GPS coordinates to your network of contacts.*
*We hope to build support for peripheral devices.*

## How does MayDay work?

**TAKE TIME to set-up MayDay somewhere safe and quiet**

**Create a plan with your contacts so that they are PREPARED to ACT**

**CHECK you are ready and that your mobile phone has credit and battery**

**ACTIVATE MayDay in an emergency by rapidly pressing the phone's power button**

**Your network will receive an SMS and regular updates of your location helping them to ACT FAST**

## The Organisations behind MayDay

The MayDay project is a fork of PanicButton which is an initiative of Amnesty International in collaboration with key advisors and partners including Frontline Defenders, iilab and the engine room.


## Technology Requirements

#### Android

There are several resources available for wearable technologies on the Android Developer Portal

#### Samsung 

**Gear** and **Gear Fit** are different. Unfortunetly Samsung has multiple wearable SDKs specific for different devices

##### Gear Fit 
Uses a Samsung developed SDK called CUP SDK. http://forum.xda-developers.com/gear-fit/development/samsung-gear-fit-sdk-available-t2872803
