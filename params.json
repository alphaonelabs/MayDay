Special thanks go to the network of human rights activists from more than ten countries who have worked with us over the months to collaboratively design the app and have given many hours feeding back on the usability and functionality of the app.\r\n\r\nA huge thanks is also owed to the many programmers and designers who have donated their time and skills to develop the app over the past two years. We are especially grateful to the OpenIDEO community for kick-starting the project and to ThoughtWorks who generously helped to develop the first working prototype of the app.\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nYou need an Android phone with a minimum version of 2.3.3 \r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\nSee the [notes to build your own APK](./docs/BUILD.md)\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nSee the [notes to setup a development environment](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)\r\n\r\nCode contributions should be sent via github from [feature](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/) [branches](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (named feature/__descriptive_name_of_feature__) as pull requests [as explained here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
